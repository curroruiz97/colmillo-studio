# COLMILLO STUDIO - EXECUTION STATE

Persistent handoff document for Codex sessions. This describes the actual
repository state, not an aspirational roadmap.

## Last Updated

2026-09-09

## Current Phase

The technical foundation, isolated demonstration and full creative-polish phase
are complete. Phase 4 content intake and the intentional Phase 6/7 release
gates remain blocked only by client deliverables and approvals.

## Completed

- Preserved the Astro 7.3.1 static foundation, strict TypeScript, native CSS,
  GSAP/ScrollTrigger motion controller, semantic routes and prelaunch indexing
  guard.
- Added three typed fictional projects that are automatically available in
  development and in Astro `demo` mode. Every card and detail repeats
  `DEMO FICTICIA — NO PUBLICAR`.
- Added reusable project cards, accessible abstract CSS covers, project hero,
  service/year/summary metadata, responsive gallery, previous/next navigation
  and return to the project index.
- Added `build:demo`, which writes the twelve-page demonstration only to
  `dist-demo/`. The standard build remains nine pages and contains no demo
  routes, strings or assets.
- Completed the horizontal rail with fine-pointer GSAP enhancement, semantic
  controls, focus synchronization, continuous/discrete progress, active-card
  feedback, reduced-motion behavior and native horizontal overflow when
  JavaScript is disabled.
- Revisited the supplied live references and translated their durable ideas
  into Colmillo-specific behavior: a velocity/press-responsive contextual
  cursor, rounded sticky layers that visibly compress under the incoming
  section, a numbered side progress rail and an original CSS goodbye scene.
- Added permanent `/manifiesto/` and `/studio/` routes with unique metadata,
  explicit header/home/contact navigation and visually complete demonstration
  narratives. Provisional narrative blocks are visibly marked and excluded
  from the standard artifact.
- Rebuilt `/contacto/` as an orange editorial hero, dark channel stage and
  internal continuation map. Confirmed contact channels remain centralized and
  null, so no email, telephone or social profile was invented.
- Processed the user-supplied black and cream wordmarks with deterministic
  matte-to-alpha recovery, a tight crop and an even 12 px transparent margin.
  The responsive header now uses black on its cream treatment and cream on the
  dark Contacto treatment, with intrinsic dimensions and no JavaScript
  dependency. `check:brand` validates RGBA, dimensions, antialiased edges and
  clear space.
- Completed an additional responsive pass for the new routes and the existing
  route set at 1440×1000, 834×1112, 390×844 and 320×720. Removed the rem-based
  document minimum that caused overflow at 200% text sizing.
- Corrected the hero continuation link so it resolves to `#manifiesto` only
  when that section is rendered and otherwise resolves to `#contacto`.
- Expanded the dormant official hero media contract to desktop/mobile WebM and
  MP4 sources, explicit media queries, poster fallback, intrinsic dimensions,
  out-of-viewport pause and reduced-motion pause/static behavior.
- Moved tablet/desktop fixed controls into a reserved right rail and added
  mobile hero/footer clearance. Automated geometry checks cover hero, contact,
  footer, project copy and project navigation at 1440×1000, 834×1112 and
  390×844.
- Removed active ClientRouter navigation after rapid history QA exposed a
  rejected transition. Native navigation now owns back/forward; a short CSS
  bite reveal on `main` supplies non-blocking page-entry motion.
- Added safe environment parsing and types for every project environment
  variable. Invalid canonical origins and invalid boolean approvals fail
  closed.
- Added conditional favicon support, canonical normalization, `og:image` and
  `og:image:alt` support, project `article` metadata, and unique route
  descriptions. No unverifiable structured data was added.
- Added local route/fragment validation for all rendered anchors.
- Made `release-manifest.mjs` exclude any prior `release-manifest.json` before
  hashing; an automated double-run check proves stable file entries.
- Reduced layout work in magnetic interactions by caching bounds on pointer
  entry.
- Corrected the runbook to GPT-5.6 Sol, high reasoning and standard service.
- Replaced the competing fixed utilities with a mathematically centered menu
  trigger and a full-viewport editorial navigation surface. The panel includes
  numbered routes, project return, motion preference and legal links; Escape,
  focus containment/restoration and `inert` behavior are implemented while the
  native `<details>` fallback remains usable without JavaScript.
- Simplified the global header to logo plus current-route context until real
  contact channels exist. The supplied black/cream variants continue to switch
  by surface with intrinsic dimensions.
- Unified hero, editorial pages, stacked sections, project cards and cursor
  through bounded pointer, velocity, surface-tone and progress state. Added
  hero exit compression, whole-block editorial reveals, pressure edges and
  active-project depth without another dependency or permanent frame loop.
- Added responsive menu/project clearance and an automated ±1 px centering
  assertion across 1440×1000, 834×1112, 390×844 and 320×720.
- Tested cross-document View Transitions and removed them after reproducing a
  touch back/forward rejection. Native navigation and the short CSS entry remain
  authoritative; the entry does not scale the viewport and is disabled when
  scripting or motion is disabled.
- Removed root-level hover scaling from the hero CTA so its hit area stays
  stable without JavaScript; the visual pressure response now occurs on its
  content/pseudo-element.

## Work In Progress

- None. All reversible technical and demonstration work in the current plan is
  complete.

## Intentional Blockers

- Favicon and original vector logo master for the final brand archive.
- Licensed Bootzy TM and More Sugar WOFF2 files.
- Final brand manual and spacing/background rules.
- Official hero and goodbye animation sources plus approved optimized
  WebM/MP4/poster derivatives.
- Approved home copy, services, projects/media, contact channels, social links,
  legal text, SEO copy, social image, canonical domain and project ordering.
- Explicit release and indexing approvals, hosting selection and deployment
  authorization.

These are client/content/production decisions, not technical failures. No
placeholder has been promoted to production.

## Current Repository Facts

- Package manager: npm 11 with committed `package-lock.json`.
- Codex project default: `gpt-5.6-sol`, high reasoning effort, standard
  `default` service tier.
- Runtime observed: Node 24.19.0.
- Git history is initialized on `main` and the public `origin` is
  `https://github.com/curroruiz97/colmillo-studio.git`. The initial publication
  was explicitly authorized by the user on 2026-09-09.
- Framework: Astro 7.3.1, static output; TypeScript 6.0.3 strictest mode.
- Motion: GSAP 3.15.0 + ScrollTrigger; centered native-details menu, shared
  pressure/surface state, native document navigation and CSS page entry reveal.
- Standard output: `dist/`, nine pages, demo forbidden.
- Local demo output: `dist-demo/`, twelve pages including three fictional detail
  routes; never deployable.
- Project collection: typed local glob loader, currently empty and publication
  disabled until approved entries arrive.
- Prelaunch indexing: `noindex` and blocking `robots.txt` remain active.
- Header brand assets: supplied transparent black 906×242 and cream 865×232
  PNG wordmarks under `public/assets/brand/`.

## Last Successful Validations

- `npm.cmd run validate`: passed — Astro check reported 0 errors/warnings/hints,
  ESLint passed, Prettier passed, both supplied wordmarks passed the RGBA/crop
  contract, the hero contract passed, the production build passed, production
  integrity passed and nine production HTML files passed link validation.
- Standard production integrity: 16 generated files and 126,717 uncompressed
  JavaScript bytes before manifest generation; no demo content, development
  placeholders or GIFs.
- `npm.cmd run test:e2e`: 25 passed, 3 skipped. The skips are intentional
  capability-specific duplicates; the suite now includes centered-menu
  geometry, full-panel keyboard behavior and no-JavaScript stability.
- `npm.cmd run test:e2e:demo`: 29 passed, 10 skipped. The capability-gated
  cursor, side-progress, pinned-rail, compact-width and text-scaling assertions
  run only where meaningful; their touch duplicates are deliberately skipped.
- Demo link validation: twelve HTML files checked with no missing route or
  fragment.
- Visual Chromium QA completed at 1440×1000, 834×1112 and 390×844 across home,
  open/closed menu, project rail, project index/detail, Manifiesto, Studio,
  Goodbye, Contacto and 404. The polish pass corrected panel focus, mobile
  project navigation clearance, header hierarchy, page-entry viewport coverage
  and stable no-JavaScript CTA interaction. Legal routes remain included in the
  console/overflow suite. Reduced motion, fine pointer, touch and no-JavaScript
  states passed.
- Manifiesto, Studio and Contacto received dedicated top/interior screenshots at
  1440×1000, 834×1112, 390×844 and 320×720; root overflow remained zero. A 200%
  text-size probe also remained at zero overflow across the editorial, project
  index and privacy routes.
- Local performance assertions passed: CLS < 0.1, LCP < 2.5 s, no horizontal
  overflow and JavaScript below 220 KB.
- `npm.cmd run check:manifest`: passed after two consecutive generations; 16
  stable files, manifest self-entry excluded.
- `npm.cmd audit`: found 0 vulnerabilities.
- The invalid-environment probe rejected `PUBLIC_RELEASE_APPROVED=yes`.
- Release-mode asset intake intentionally exited 1 and listed the 11 missing
  official files/font slots.

## Expected Failing Gates

- `npm.cmd run release:check`: intentionally blocked with exactly three missing
  prerequisites — canonical HTTPS origin, release approval and indexing
  approval.
- `REQUIRE_CLIENT_ASSETS=true npm run check:assets`: intentionally blocked by
  the 11 remaining official asset/font slots listed above. The two wordmarks
  are no longer reported missing.

## Changed Files

- Added project model/demo data under `src/data/` and reusable project
  components under `src/components/projects/`.
- Added `src/pages/manifiesto.astro` and `src/pages/studio.astro`; rebuilt
  `src/pages/contacto.astro`, primary navigation and home section routes.
- Updated project routes, home rail, hero, SEO/layout components, content schema
  and responsive/motion styles.
- Updated motion lifecycle to native navigation; removed the unused
  `PageTransitions.ts` module.
- Added demo Playwright configuration and expanded production/demo,
  accessibility, performance, overlap, history, console and no-JavaScript
  coverage.
- Added link, responsive-hero and manifest-idempotence scripts; hardened release
  and production checks.
- Added deterministic logo preparation and brand-alpha validation scripts;
  replaced the text wordmark with responsive supplied-image variants.
- Updated package scripts, environment declarations/examples, ignore rules and
  all affected project documentation.
- Rebuilt the global menu/header composition and added `EditorialMotion.ts` and
  `SurfaceTone.ts`; refined hero, stack, project and cursor controllers plus
  their responsive styles and Playwright contracts.
- Simplified the native-document motion bootstrap to one controller mount per
  page, eliminating a redundant initial Astro lifecycle remount found during
  repeated cursor QA.

## Next Concrete Action

Request and ingest the official licensed fonts, hero/goodbye media, approved
copy, real projects, contact/legal data, favicon/vector master and canonical
domain. Then replace the gated demonstration content and repeat visual/content
approval before enabling either release or indexing. No further technical work
from the current creative-polish plan is pending.
